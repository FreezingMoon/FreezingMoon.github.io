<p style="text-align: justify;">In this video, which was planned as a series, I will show you how to create some fireworks with the help of multiple particle systems. The end result is not realistic, but you will learn the basics.  I recorded the tutorial in multiple parts, because YouTube only lets me upload 15 minutes, but when I got to upload the video, I found a message saying that I can upload even 1 hour long videos as well. Well, because I won't have to pay attention to the clock and the editing, I will make more detailed videos. Keeping track of what I did and what was I saying before is a bit hard, but that won't matter anymore.</p>
