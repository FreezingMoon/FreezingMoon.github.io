<p style="text-align: justify;">In this video, I am going to teach you, how to use a digital painting, or a picture as a guideline, and how to create a 3d version of the subject of your image.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The provider of the painting is So&oacute;s M&aacute;t&eacute; Gerg≈ë, many thanks for it! <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://random223.deviantart.com/gallery">Click here to see his gallery.</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Magma Spike was made for a game: Ancient Beast. Its going to be a turn based strategy game, and I am showing you my everyday working pipeline with this tutorial.  I will show you the easiest case, because I just have to use only one side picture of the object. The blade of the axe is pretty complex, and I couldn't trace it with a 100% accuracy, but things like that happen, I will correct that mistake later on, when I get to tweaking and texturing it actually.  I use the basic techniques over and over, so I wont comment every step. You can follow my hotkey-use thanks to Paulo: every button I press is displayed on the bottom left corner. This video is not for beginners, but I think that newbies can follow it as well. The whole method is just about polishing our problem solving skills, and using the right techniques at the right time in the right order.</p>
