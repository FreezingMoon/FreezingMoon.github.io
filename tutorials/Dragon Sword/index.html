<p style="text-align: justify;">I decided to do this tutorial even though I was a bit ill while I recorded it. The main focus now, is all about texturing, how to unwrap a sword and how to make colour maps for it. This piece is ready to work in Blender Game Engine even though it could be tweaked furthermore. I hope you like it, and I promise to be way more focused from now on :)</p>
