<p style="text-align: justify;">So, its wintertime, and there is lots of snow around here. I thought that I could come up with a seasonal themed tutorial this time, and I wanted to do some more effects with the particle system as well. People told me to rotate my leaves with wind, to swirl them, and they asked me for more particle system tutorials. Now you will get it: two types of snowfall with the particle system and you will even create a forest onto a simple plane!  In the first part, I will show you how to make some snowflakes, then you will learn how to make trees and after that, how to generate a forest out of them, and the last two parts will show you how to move your camera and focus point, and you will learn how to do some effects with the composite node as well.  If you don't want to create the snowflakes, nor the forest by yourself, here are my production files with the textures. If you hit animate on my scene.blend, you should get the exact same result as I had with the one uploaded to YouTube.</p>
